    <h1>Street Art</h1>
    <p>Street Art, as the name suggests, is an art created on the street and in open spaces. The term includes graffities and murals, but also any sculptures, stickers, posters, video projections and art installations that are not confined by any building. Street art has no set rules, everyone creates according to their own rules, using the methods they want to create. The tradition of the trend is impermanent, illegal works are often removed by cleaning services. Recently, more and more often, the authorities take the initiative and employ artists.</p>
    <h3>Forms of Street Art:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Mural</h4>
            <img src="images/mural.jpg" alt="Example of mural found in Rotterdam" class="custom-image" onmouseover="zoomInImage(this, '500px')" onmouseout="zoomOutImage(this, '400px')">
            <p class="image-source">Example of mural found in Rotterdam</p>
            <p>A word coming from Spanish and meaning a large-scale painting painted on the wall for decorative purposes. The term most often used to refer to large-format paintings that are created on the walls of buildings. Murals are planned and carefully executed on walls, sometimes even with the help of scaffolding.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Graffiti</h4>
            <p>This term describes the textual forms of street art, most often done with a spray or brush. The images only serve as a background or padding. Often the style of writing letters is so elaborate that reading the inscription could be a problem. A characteristic feature is making images in a hurry, which results in little attention to detail. Initially, the authors made their inscriptions only in illegal places, without having time to work out the details.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Sticker</h4>
            <p>Small form of street art, which is somewhere on the border of advertising and art. Stickers most often appear in large clusters on advertising poles, municipal electrical boxes, gutters or in buses. They usually have a single idea to communicate. They can be a form of advertising for street artists, contain their pseudonym or Instagram account name or they can be just a simple drawing with a funny slogan. They make an interesting impression when they are in large groups.</p>

            <h4>Tag</h4>
            <p>Graffiti artist's signature on the wall. Usually done very quickly, without any additional frills and details. It is the simplest form of graffiti. There is also peculiar type of tags known as "moving tag", which means a signature made on the train.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Main Street Art creators</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>TAKI 183</h4>
            <p>One of the first and most recognizable taggers was TAKI 183. The artist worked as a courier, delivering parcels by subway, tagging the city. He became famous for having the most tags in all of New York at one point in his "career".</p>

            </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Banksy</h4>
            <p>Artistic pseudonym of the creator of world-famous murals. His real name and face are shrouded in mystery. His murals are a combination of graffiti and stencil painting. He deliberately creates his works in such a way as to confuse the audience. Street art in his performance forces to think, and accidental places of implementation mean that it is possible to come across them unexpectedly in different places around the world.</p>
